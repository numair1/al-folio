I'm a fourth year doctoral researcher working on Machine Learning and Causal Inference, advised by Dr. Ilya Shpitser. My research agenda involves methodology development to answer challenging questions that arise when Machine Learning is applied in the healthcare realm. 

I have expertise in Graphical Models, Observational Causal Inference and Double Machine Learning and have written research papers on these topics. I believe my experience in both the applied Machine Learning as well the theoretic Machine Learning realms equips me with a unique perspective when it comes to solving problems and answering questions.

I'm a fourth year doctoral researcher working on Machine Learning and Causal Inference, advised by Dr. Ilya Shpitser. My research agenda involves methodology development to answer challenging questions that arise when Machine Learning is applied in the healthcare realm. 

I have expertise in Graphical Models, Observational Causal Inference and Double Machine Learning and have written research papers on these topics. I believe my experience in both the applied Machine Learning as well the theoretic Machine Learning realms equips me with a unique perspective when it comes to solving problems and answering questions.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
